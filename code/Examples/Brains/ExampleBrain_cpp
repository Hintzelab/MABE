// makeBrain() is a function which creates a brain. This new brain
// may be constructed using one or more genomes, or from scratch.
//
// Conseptualy, in MABE, we think of brains being build from genomes
// (that is, genomes probide instructions or a blueprints to build
// brains). Brains can be build from more then one genome. CGP brains
// consist of a mathimatical formula for each brain output, and one
// method to construct CGP brains uses one genome to define each
// formula.
//
// Brains may also be constructed from scratch or by hand in the
// case of "directly encoded brains" (i.e. brains that are not
// translated from a genome(s)). Directly Encoded Brains, are a
// diffrent class of brain, beyond not being constructed from
// genomes, these brains must provide their own means of mutation
// (which acts directly on the structures of the brain.)
//
// the makeBrain() function is provided with _genomes which is all
// of the genomes contained in the parent organism. These genomes
// are stored in a map which associates name space names with genomes.
// _genomes["sheep::"] will refer to the genome created using paramters
// associated with the "sheep::" namespace
//
// Genomes can be thought of as containers full of data which can
// only be accessed by using a genome handler. Genome handlers are tools
// which standardize interactions with genomes.

	// the process by which you can build a brain is a varied as the types of
	// brains you can build and will be based on factors such as the operation
	// of the brain and wether it is geneticly or directly encoded. If you 
	// are unsure about how to proceed, I suggest that you look at other MABE

// resetBrain() is used to initialize a brain. Some information in a brain
// is derived from the genome (or inherited from parent brains directly), but
// other information may be related to the brains current state. Consider a
// brain that has inputs, outputs, logic gates, three memory locations and,
// wires which connect these components. Consider that a genome is used to
// define the logic gates, and wire the logic gates to inputs, outputs and
// memory locations. In this brain, resetBrain() would only reset the contents
// of the memory locations (perhaps to 0).
// Now consider that this brain has in place of logic gates, threshold gates.
// These threshold gates sum inputs over time until an internal genteticly
// determined threshold is reached and they send out some signal.
// resetBrain() in this new brain would still clear the memory locations,
// but would also reset the summations on each threshold gate to some default.
// 
// In addtion to any user defined reset behavor, a call is also made to

	// This code assumes 2 inputs and 1 output. If a brain does
	// require a certain minimu number of inputs or outputs, you

// copied (this is particularly imprtant for genomes, which are large and

// but you are going to randomize it's contents, there is no need to spend

// you can pass a PT to make copy. This PT may contain diffrent parameters
// settings then the brain being copied, and so the resulting brain may

// In make copy it is often nessacary to copy structures which were built from
